Welcome to our Mario Party!

With our project, you can play a simplified version of Mario Party! Two players will play on the same computer for 10 turns. Each player starts with 20 coins. In each turn, each player will roll the die and land on a spot where they will gain/lose a certain amount of coins. After each player traverses the board, a minigame will randomly be selected for them to play. The winner of the minigame will receive 10 coins. The player with the most coins at the end wins.

Instructions:
- At the home page, either click "New Game" if you're a newcomer or enter the game ID of your old game (if you want to continue).
- At the board page, Player 1 should press the s key to roll the die and move their character (the red one). Afterwards, Player 2 should press the k key to roll the die and move their character (the green one). When both characters have rolled the die, they are given a button that redirects them to a minigame.
- At the dino minigame, the players start the game with the y key. Player 1 operates the top screen and Player 2 operates the botton screen. Player 1 and Player 2 jump with the w and i key, respectively. Once a player loses, they are given a button that redirects them to the board.
- At the slot machine minigame, the players start the game with the y key. Player 1 operates the left slot machine and stops the left, middle, and right columns with the a, s, and d keys, respectively. Player 2 operates the right slot machine and stops the left, middle, and right columns with the j, k, and l keys, respectively. After both players are done stopping their machines, the b key gives them their scores and a button that redirects them to the board.
